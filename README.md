# Building

There are some nuances to trying to build GitGood. For reasons we could never determine, the game will not build with the test files. This has something to do with the test assembly causing issues with the production build. In order to build GitGood:

1. Delete the `Assets/Tests` Directory
2. Delete `Assets/Scripts/Main.asmdef`
3. Delete `Assets/3rd-Party/Fungus/Fungus.meta`
4. Click Fileâ†’Build Settings to get to the build settings window
